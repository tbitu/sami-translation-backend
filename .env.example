# Configuration (optional)
# Copy this file to .env and modify as needed.
#
# Note: the server is started via uvicorn and the repo defaults to port 8000.
# Host/port are typically configured by Docker/Compose/Kubernetes.

# Hugging Face cache (recommended)
#
# In Docker/Compose, persist /data/hf so the service doesn't re-download multi-GB
# artifacts on every restart.
#
# Recommended: use a Docker named volume (see docker-compose.yml and README).
# Optional: bind-mount a host directory instead (HF_CACHE_HOST_DIR below).
#
# IMPORTANT: If you run `docker compose` from inside a devcontainer, `$HOME` may
# be `/root`, which would make `${HOME}/.cache/huggingface` point at `/root/...`
# on the *host* and fail under rootless Docker. Set an explicit host path here.
# Examples:
# HF_CACHE_HOST_DIR=/home/<your-user>/.cache/huggingface
# HF_CACHE_HOST_DIR=/srv/hf-cache

# In-process Hugging Face cache directory (passed to huggingface_hub.snapshot_download)
# HF_CACHE_DIR=/data/hf
# MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/data/hf  # legacy alias

# Optional: private Hugging Face repos
# HF_TOKEN=...
